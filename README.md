# CGV_AtomSimulation
computer graphics mini project


All you need to get started with CGV Project

Essentials and Fundamentals to keep in mind for your Computer Graphics Visualisations Mini-Project.

Installation
You can build your project in two preferable ways.

1. Use the Fedora Virtual Box VM from the college department which has already OPENGL setup for you. (No additional Installation Required)
2. Use OpenGL in windows or mac.
For Windows, I would suggest to setup with Codeblocks. Debugging will be more productive than VS Code or other Code Editors.

Link for CodeBlocks Version 17.02 (Mandatorily use this version only)
